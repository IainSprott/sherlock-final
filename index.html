      <h2>
        Sherlock Holmes
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        A fictional private detective created by British author
        Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Known as a ‘consulting detective’ in the stories,
        Holmes is known for a proficiency with observation, forensic science, and
        logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs when
        investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.
        Amongst other foibles, Holmes had a penchant for papier maché.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        First appearing in print in 1887 in ‘A Study in Scarlet’, the character’s
        popularity became widespread with the first series of short stories in The
        Strand Magazine, beginning with ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ in 1891.
        Additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling four
        novels and 56 short stories.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        All but one are set in the Victorian or Edwardian periods, taking place
        between about 1880 to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of
        Holmes’s friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies
        Holmes during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at
        the address of 221B Baker Street, London, where many of the stories begin.
      </p>

    <div class="watson js-textbox">
      <h2>
        Dr John H. Watson
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        A medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary
        Watson and is arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In the debut Holmes story ‘A Study in Scarlet’, Watson, as the narrator,
        describes meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B
        Baker Street, his attempts to discover the profession of his taciturn
        companion, Holmes’s eventual taking of Watson into his confidence,
        and the events surrounding their first case together. Watson describes
        Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner for
        Holmes’ taste. In time, they become close friends.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In ‘The Sign of Four’, John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife.
        Mary seemed somewhat less sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly
        calling him ‘James’ in the short story ‘The Man With the Twisted Lip’.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated
        that it is a wifely reference to Watson’s unknown middle name, which could
        have been ‘Hamish’ (Scottish for ‘James’). Dorothy Sayers, creator of the
        detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who also wrote several essays on Holmesian
        speculation, later publishing this theory in ‘Unpopular Opinions’.

      <h2>
        Irene Adler
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Professionally known as ‘The Woman’, is a brilliant dominatrix
        who has an apparently romantic attraction to Sherlock Holmes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Whilst Mycroft – Holmes’ elder brother (by seven years) – is telling
        Sherlock about Irene, he states that she is a dominatrix who gives out
        ‘recreational scolding’ to people. She has been in the middle of two
        political scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author,
        in which she had an affair with both sides.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        She is brought to Sherlock’s attention when he and John are summoned to
        Buckingham Palace by Mycroft and are asked to take on a case of national
        importance. Irene had taken compromising images of a young female
        member of the British Royal family during a dominatrix session.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock
        is tasked in getting them back. She is using them, and
        other information for her ‘protection’.

      <h2>
        Professor James Moriarty
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics
        professor turned the world’s only ‘consulting criminal’. His genius is equal to, if
        not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the
        ‘Napoleon of crime’. Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard
        inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, who
        is one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan
        Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes
        stories.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Moriarty is a genius, a philosopher and an abstract thinker, with a brain of the
        first order. As Holmes puts it: “He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its
        web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of
        each of them.”
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been proven to be the most d
        angerous of all criminals that Holmes encounters. In the short story ‘The A
        dventure of the Final Problem’, during a fight with Holmes above the Reichenbach
        Falls, Moriarty falls to his death.
